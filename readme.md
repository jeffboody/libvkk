VKK Library
===========

The Vulkan Kit (VKK) is a high level graphics API layered
on the low level Vulkan graphics API.

Vulkan is very different from the former OpenGL graphics
standard due to its low level API. The low level API
provides developers with an unprecedented capability to
optimze algorithms for each apps workload. Optimized
algorithms can greatly impact an apps performance, memory
usage, rendering quality and portability. The low level
API also allows hardware vendors to provide a much simpler
driver thats easier to test resulting in fewer bugs and
better consistency across devices. However, an important
tradeoff of the low level API is that it requires
developers to implement many algorithms that were
historically included by the OpenGL graphics driver.
Example algorithms include memory management, internal
synchronization, data conversion, resource updates and
command pooling. These algoritms can be time consuming to
develop and may require significant expertise to implement
properly.

VKK simplifies development of graphics apps by exposing a
high level graphics API which includes support for an
important subset of commonly used Vulkan design concepts
and underlying graphics algorithms. These include
multithreaded rendering, graphics pipelines, secondary
command buffers and low overhead resource updates. The
underlying Vulkan implementation is abstracted allowing
the developer to focus on implementing graphics concepts.

The following sections describe the core/platform/ui APIs.

VKK Core
--------

The core graphics features exposed by VKK include.

* Single header file (vkk.h)
* Rendering to the display
* Image rendering (e.g. render to texture)
* Image stream rendering (e.g. render to texture)
* Secondary rendering (e.g. render to command buffer)
* Multithreaded rendering, creation and destruction
* Graphics pipeline with vertex and fragment shader stages
* Graphics memory is automatically pooled and suballocated
* Shader support for uniform buffers and images
* 2D and 3D images with optional mipmapping are supported
* Triangles are the only primitive supported
* Transparency, depth clearing, viewport and scissors

See [VKK Core](core/readme.md) for more details.

VKK Platform
------------

The platform features exposed by VKK include.

* Single header file (vkk\_platform.h)
* Cross-platform support for Linux and Android
* Application lifecycle management
* Screen density events for UI scaling
* Keyboard, touch and joystick events
* Android sensor events (accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope, and GPS)
* Android permissions (location and storage)

See [VKK Platform](platform/readme.md) for more details.

VKK UI
------

The VKK UI library is an experimental widget library that is
built on top of the VKK library.

The following standard widgets are included.

* actionBar
* bulletbox
* checkbox
* hline
* infoPanel
* layer
* listbox
* radiolist
* sprite
* statusBar
* text
* textbox
* widget
* window

See [VKK UI](ui/readme.md) for more details.

Dependencies
============

The VKK library uses
[libcc](https://github.com/jeffboody/libcc)
for logging, memory tracking, data structures (e.g.
lists/maps), threading constructs and vector math
operations. Note that you may find it useful to use the
cc\_mat4f\_perspective() and cc\_mat4f\_orthoVK() functions
to prepare the perspective projection and orthographic
projection matrices since viewport origin has flipped from
OpenGL to Vulkan.

Resource file support is provided by
[libbfs](https://github.com/jeffboody/libbfs) and
[SQLite](https://github.com/jeffboody/libsqlite3).

Image support is provided by
[texgz](https://github.com/jeffboody/texgz),
[lodepng](https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng) and
[myjpeg](https://github.com/jeffboody/jpeg).

XML support is provided by
[xmlstream](https://github.com/jeffboody/libxmlstream) and
[libexpat](https://github.com/jeffboody/libexpat).

Android platform support is provided by
[vkk-java](https://github.com/jeffboody/vkk-java).

Resource File
=============

The app must provide a resource file which may contain
shaders, images, icons, fonts and any other resources.
The resource file is named resource.bfs and can be
generated by the BFS tool found at libbfs/bfs. The
resource file must be installed at the engine resource
path.

The following example shows how to generate a resource
file.

	bfs resource.bfs blobSet readme.txt
	bfs resource.bfs blobSet shader_vert.spv
	bfs resource.bfs blobSet shader_frag.spv

See the
[Engine](core/readme.md)
section for details on the resource path.

Example

Open source examples include
[Gears VK](https://github.com/jeffboody/gearsvk) and
[Precomputed Atmospheric Scattering](https://github.com/jeffboody/precomputed_atmospheric_scattering/tree/master/atmosphere/demovk).

The VKK library is also used by the
[Trekking Maps](https://www.3dgesoftware.com/)
app which is available on the Google Play Store.
